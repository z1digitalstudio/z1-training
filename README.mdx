# Z1 Training

## Launch the app

First, we need to install all dependencies with yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

After that, you can run the project in dev mode:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Project structure

### Configuration files

- **config**
  - `postcss.config.js`. PostCSS config.
  - `webpack.common.js`. Webpack common config.
  - `webpack.config.babel.js`. Webpack main config file. If you run webpack using the CLI you should point to this configuration file and use the `--env` parameter.
  - `webpack.dev.js`. Webpack dev environment config.
  - `webpack.production.js`. Webpack production environment config.
- `.babelrc`. Babel config.
- `.eslintrc`. ESLint config.
- `.prettierrc`. Prettier config.
- `package.json`. Contains the project dependencies and some scripts.
- `tsconfig.json`. TypeScript config.

### Source code and assets

- **src**
  - **styles**. SASS styles.
    - **lib**. Folder that includes some external libraries that don't have a NPM package.
    - `_fonts.scss`. Fonts used in the project.
    - `_functions.scss`. [INJECTED] Functions that can be used inside all components.
    - `_reset.scss`. CSS Reset.

    - `_transitions.scss`. [INJECTED] Transitions that can be used inside all components.
    - `_variables.scss`. [INJECTED] Variables that can be used inside all components. **CSS Variables don't belong here!**
    - `global.scss`. Global styles. For example, CSS variables should be defined here.
  - `App.tsx`. Component that represents the app.
  - `index.tsx`. Entry point of the entire application. Mounts the App and imports the global styles.
- **public**. Here you can include files that won't be transformed in the build pipeline, with the exception of the `index.html`, which acts as a template.
